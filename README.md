# 🕵️ Excel Project – Police Crime Investigation Dashboard

## Overview
This Excel dashboard provides a deep dive into crime trends reported by UK police forces over several financial years. It leverages pivot tables, slicers, and dynamic visuals to identify high-crime periods, common offense types, and active regions. The goal is to inform investigative priorities and resource deployment through clear, data-driven insights.

## 🎯 Project Objective
To analyze patterns in crime data across years, regions, and offense types using Microsoft Excel, and to visualize key indicators that can support policy-making and law enforcement strategy.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following columns:
- `Financial Year` – The year the crime was recorded (e.g., 2012/2013)
- `Financial Quarter` – Quarter of the year (Q1–Q4)
- `Force Name` – Reporting police force (e.g., Metropolitan Police)
- `Offense Description` – Specific crime (e.g., Assault without injury)
- `Offense Group` – Broader category (e.g., Theft Offenses)
- `Offense Subgroup` – Sub-category (e.g., Miscellaneous crimes against society)
- `Offense Code` – Unique identifier for the offense
- `Number of Offenses` – Volume of reported offenses
